# Bonus Part
In the bonus part of the project some additional tasks were assigned. Many of them are integrated to project itself, though two of them were semi-integrated projects. 

Hereby, under this directory, you can find them in two seperated folders as [alert_script](./alert_script/) and [gitlab-cicd-runner](./gitlab-cicd-runner/). 

## What were the tasks?

1. [alert_script](./alert_script/) : A script that sends an e-mail if the disk usage exceeds 90% .
2. [gitlab-cicd-runner](./gitlab-cicd-runner/): Explanation and configuration file to setup your own runner instead of using GitLab's shared runners.
